  "summary": "Professional video editor with unified architecture featuring timeline engine, keyframe animations (Alight Motion style), WebGL GPU rendering, shader-based effects (After Effects style), multi-format export (video/GIF/image sequences), and Motoko backend for project persistence. Home page redesigned with CapCut-inspired layout: search bar with filters, Recent Projects horizontal carousel, Create section (Video Edit/Photo Edit/Auto Cut), AI Tools wizard-based interfaces, and Templates section with animated 3D preview cards. Features glassmorphism UI, Framer Motion animations, global 3D page transitions, Three.js background, and mobile-responsive design. Comprehensive AI orchestration layer with expanded feature set across 8 AI categories: Generation AI (text→image/video, voice cloning with ElevenLabs, music generation, B-roll, logos, stickers, character consistency, face-aware generation), Editing AI (highlight detection, timeline intelligence with AI-suggested cuts/effects/zooms, motion AI with auto keyframes/easing/camera shake/parallax), Enhancement AI (HDR enhancement, skin tone correction, flicker removal, face restoration, old video restoration), Creator AI (word-level subtitle animation with emoji insertion, template system with auto-apply, brand kit integration, object/face tracking, AI glow/blur effects, green screen removal), Assistant AI (enhanced context-aware chat with command interface), Growth AI (title/hook/caption generators, hashtag AI, best posting time recommendations, virality prediction with hook analysis/retention/scroll-stop scores, A/B caption testing), Experimental AI (actor replacement, AI avatar presenter, eye contact correction, AI hand gestures, script→edited video, AI camera framing), and System AI (AI caching, smart job scheduling, device-aware quality optimization, lag prediction & avoidance). All features implemented with complete UI/UX workflows, full job submission flows ready to plug into AI APIs (Replicate, ElevenLabs, Runway), and actual Motoko backend logic with performance optimizations. Features unified AIJob type system, Motoko backend job manager with persistent queue and optimization logic, dual AI integration (mock + API integration points), and seamless video editor integration.",
